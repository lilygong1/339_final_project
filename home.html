  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="Formula One is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the FIA. 
  I've been a fan since COVID, and it's been fun to learn more about the rich history of the sport as well as learn more about the teams.
   My favorite team is Ferrari, which currently has drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz. This year, they finished third in the constructors championship, which is the team championship. 
   Next year, Ferrari fans are hoping for an improved and more competitive car so we might have a chance at winning the championship next year.">

  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="Weightlifting is not just a sport, but a way to maintain health and discipline. It's a key part of my routine for staying active.
  My current split, or lifting schedule is six days a week, with a day off for rest or to go to pilates. My favorite days of the week are pull days, which target back and bicep muscles!
  Lifting is a great way for me to structure my day, as I usually start the day by going to the gym. This helps me maintain a good amount of energy throughout the day and motivates me to wake up early.
  Additionally, my interest in weightlifting has also helped me improve my diet. Over time, I have slowly shifted to eating foods that are high in protein, and I am generally more conscious about the health level
  of foods that I put into my body.">

  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel that captures the nuances of early 19th-century life in England. I have seen this movie quite a few times,
  and it's something that I can watch over and over again without getting bored of it. One of my favorite parts of this movie is the soundtrack, and I
  listen to it often. I also love the book, and I've read all of Jane Austen's novels. Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion are some other favorite Jane Austen books of mine.">

  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="Traveling opens up new horizons and is essential for personal growth. My trip to Spain is something I look forward to, for both the culture and the adventure.
  One of my favorite trips I have been on with my family was to Australia and New Zealand. There, we got to explore the nature and beauty of the two countries.
  One of my favoite parts of Australia was snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef and seeing the beautiful colors and fish. That was quite a fun adventure and I'd never seen anything like it before! 
  In New Zealand, we went to see the Hobbit set, and saw the little buildings they used for the movie and got to experience a restaurant and scenery from the movie too!">

  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="This has been one of my favorite shows for a long time! I love to watch the Great British Bake Off and see what new and exciting things the bakers can produce each season.
  Each episode features three challenges: a signature challenge which the bakers can plan and prepare in advance, a technical challenge, which is a surprise, and a showstopper challenge,
  where the bakes have to make a big dessert. One person is eliminated each episode and one person is named star baker each episode.">

  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="I have been baking since I was a young child. Once I moved to college, it became much harder to continue my baking hobby, but it is still one that I pursue when I go home.
  I have made layer cakes for birthdays and many types of pastries and pies for special occasions. One of my favorite recipes is a lemon loaf cake made with olive oil. It is the perfect breakfast or dessert food,
  and is a simple recipe I can prepare quickly. It has been a big hit at many parties and family gatherings, and it's a recipe that I have been improving over time.">

  <div class="grid-item" data-modal-content="I enjoy listening to music often, and listen to a variety of different generes depending on what I am doing at the time, and what mood i am. For example, when I go to the gym everyday, I listen to 
  rap music which motivates me to work out. When I need to focus on my work, I found that listening to techno and EDM music helps me focus and concentrate for long periods of time. In general, my favorite artists are Lana Del Ray, ASAP Rocky, and SZA.
  I usually listen to a mix of RnB, Pop, and Rap music">
